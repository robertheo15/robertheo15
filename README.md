### Hi there 👋

I am a fresh graduate from Matana University, majoring in Computer Science with a strong passion for back-end engineering and cloud computing. I'm currently learning about back-end with Golang and cloud computing. With hard and soft skills I have learned, used, and polished over the last few years, I would like to pursue and deep dive even further as a software engineer.
